Study on how to develop apps for the 3ds
My goal is to learn how to code in C and eventually make games for the 3ds with it, but when I got confident with it I'll probably create a separate repo for it.

## SETUP:
It was kinda hard to setup the development enviroment in order to build for the 3ds, but as I followed [this](https://gbatemp.net/attachments/nintendo-3ds-homebrewing-getting-started-guide-2-1-pdf.482875/) tutorial it went pretty well.

## BUILD:
If its all right with your devkitPro instalation you can just type "make" on your terminal.

## TEST:
To test you can pass the builded files to an sd card, ftp or anything an open it normally on hb launcher. But a way better version (if you're gonna just test the files) is opening the hb app launcher, pressing Y and opening the 3dslink.exe on `devkitPro/tools/bin/`, and choosing your file as the argument
